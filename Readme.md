# Point-cloud to CSG 
Simple implementation of the genetic programming code used in this [paper](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cad.2016.01.001) to generate a CSG expression from a 3D point-cloud. 
This is a pure Python version. 


## How to install / compile
Compile the segmentation program (based on Ransac) in the subdirectory 'segmentation'. It relies on the library boost. 
This code is a modified version of the code from the efficient RANSAC [paper](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-8659.2007.01016.x).

The CSG tree search program (based on genetic programming) in the subdirectory 'gp' is written in Python. It depends on NumPy only (see also the 'requirements.txt' file). 


## How to run
Assuming that the compiled programs for the segmentation is copied in the subdirectory 'bin'. 

### Step 1: Segmentation
```bash
bin/ransac_command data/test.xyzn out/test-segmented.segps [data/test.conf] > out/log.txt
```
The program 'ransac_command' has three arguments: the name of the input 3D point-cloud (first argument), the name of the output point-cloud with segmentation information (second argument), a config file (optional). 

### Step 2: Recovery step
Produce an expression for the CSG tree
```bash
python gp/gp.py out/test-segmented.fit data/test.xyzn out/test_expression.txt out/test_primitives.txt 150 3000 0.3 0.3
```
The program 'gp' has the following arguments:
* The name of the file with the list of primitives (computed by 'ransac_command')
* The name of the input 3D point-cloud 
* The name of the file where the CSG expression will be written 
* The name of the file where the list of primitives used in the CSG expression will be written 
* The number of creatures per generation 
* The maximumn number of generations 
* The mutation rate 
* The crossover rate 

### Step 3: C/C++ source file generation and evaluation
```bash
python utils/create_eval_source.py out/test-segmented.fit out/test_expression.txt out/test.cpp data/test.xyzn 
```
The C++ source code with the CSG expression can be found in the file 'out/test.cpp'. The function defined in the C++ file is an implicit surface (approximate SDF) that can be rendered by ray-tracing or after meshing with the Marching Cubes algorithm. 

Note: It is possible to generate a tree (using Graphviz format) corresponding to the CSG expression. 
```bash
python utils/tree_from_expression.py out/test_expression.txt out/test_primitives.txt out/test_tree.dot 
```
The output file is in 'out/test_tree.dot'. It can be processed with the 'dot' command of GraphViz. 


## Additional notes
### Segmentation / Fitting 
Obviously, the results depend a lot on the list of primitives passed to the CSG tree search. The version provided here uses [RANSAC](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-8659.2007.01016.x). There are several ways to improve the output of this segmentation/fitting step such as, for example: Section 4.1 of this [paper](https://doi.org/10.1145/3272127.3275006), this [paper](https://doi.org/10.5220/0008870600380048) or this [one](https://doi.org/10.5220/0010297100750084). 

### Improved CSG recovery methods 
Several methods have been devised for improving and accelerating the CSG tree search: This [work](https://doi.org/10.24132/CSRN.2018.2802.5) and this [one](https://doi.org/10.1145/3321707.3321771) still use genetic programming and propose several improvements. This [work](https://doi.org/10.1145/3272127.3275006) propose a different approach based on program synthesis.

### CSG expression optimization 
The CSG expression generated by the method above can be further optimized by considering methods such as the ones proposed in this [paper](https://doi.org/10.24132/CSRN.2020.3001.10).
